We modified the NOOP I/O scheduler inside the Linux kernel to expose the information about the number of the 
waiting I/O requests in order to determine the flow of the I/O worklaods of the selected 
databases (MongoDB & Cassandra).


This folder contains three files of the NOOP I/O schedule in Linux after being modified, and our eBPF tool that consumes the exposed information.

NOOP: 
   elevator.h      => can be found on this path: ~kernelSource/include/linux/
   noop-iosched.c  => can be found on this path: ~kernelSource/block/
Our eBPF tool: 
   NoopSchedTool.py
