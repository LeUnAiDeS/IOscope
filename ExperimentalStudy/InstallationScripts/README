Installing the kernel, BCC, and creating a MongoDB cluster On Grid5000 testbed
==============================================================================

============
Description
============

- This script is for creating a MongoDB cluster on Grid5000 testbed. The number of
[configuration, routing and sharding] servers can be passed as parameters 
(it is preferable to have three configuration servers in production).

- This script automates the communication between all the server units, 
then a sharded database is created to be held on all the sharding servers. Its sharded key is a "hashed id".


db : xilopix
collection : dump


After executing this script without errors, you can verify that the the data  on a shard server 
is distributed among all the sharding machines, you con do the verification starting from any mongo router.

example: 
- On a sharding machine prompt: 
> mongo --host (any mongo outer) --port 27017
 > use xilopix 
 > db.dump.find() # to show the entered values.



==========
Execution
==========

You should run the following command after uploding the script on any Grid5000's frontal : 

> ruby Launcher 3 2 4      # with 3 conf. servers, 2 routing servers   and 4 sharding servers.



** The script reserve all nodes on lyon site, we can make it automatic by modifing the Reservation.rb
